                        To achieve this, it was necessary to detect when the player missed a note.
                         Initial attempts involved using Tensor Flow AI to detect the game state from the screen,
                          but it was unreliable. Instead, the game’s memory was read to achieve detection. 
                          When the player misses a note, a certain section of memory changes, 
                          and a script reads the change in game state. It then sends a signal 
                          to an Arduino which triggers the stun gun’s fire button, which shocks the player holding the guitar.

                        After Gathering 10,000 profile pictures and sorting them, I used Tensorflow to 
                        train an AI to detect if an image contained anime. Once I generated the model, I then integrated it
                        into a discord bot. This Bot acts on an aggression level set by the admins, it can quarantine, kick, and
                        ban users who do not adhere to the servers profile picture policy.
